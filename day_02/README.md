### **Day 02**: Cube Conundrum

-   Part 1 was quite easy, I just make a function to count the number of cubes in each set and add them to a data frame. Then a function to take the maximum number of cubes seen in each colours across all sets. This is then used to compare against a criteria

-   Part 2 can reuse most of part 1, but instead of filtering we just take the maximum number of cubes seen as the minimum number needed to make the game possible.
