### **Day 11**: Cosmic Expansion

-   Part 1 We have another easy day and I have not fallen for the trap. I knew this expansion factor would be ridiculous in part 2 somehow so I made a function to keep track of the indices after expansion then extract all the galaxies' coordinates (`#`). After all the problem is just on a Cartesian plane of coordinates. Base R has a `dist` function that can calculate [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) matrix.

-   Part 2 It is so satisfying to just reuse everything in Part 1 and just change one number.
