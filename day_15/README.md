### **Day 15**: Lens Library

-   Part 1 was surprisingly easy and probably the shortest part 1 so far. We just need to write a short custom hash function using Reduce.

-   Part 2 was basically an introduction to hash tables and I took this opportunity to test out R `utils::hashtab` although it's still in experimental stage. It seems quite straightforward to me but you could've done part 2 with just a common list or vector. I suppose it's more useful when frequent data access and checks are needed. Reading/Understanding the problem was harder than the solution itself. It will be hard from now on though.
