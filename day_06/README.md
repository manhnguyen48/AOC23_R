### **Day 06**: Wait For It

-   Part 1 this was another easy day as we just need to count how many possible values are above the record. I implemented a brute force algorithm in part 1.

-   Part 2 I thought I had to change my code as it would've been more efficient to formulate as a quadratic equation problem where we solve for the load time. Turns out my brute force algorithm is quick enough to complete part 2 in \<2s so I'm not too bothered.
