# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in R

This is my first year solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles in R. I will try my best to complete both puzzles every day but my time is limited while working full time.

This is set up as an RStudio Project. The `utils.R` script contains the `set_up_day()` function to help download inputs and set up the folder each day. My session ID is stored as an environment variable in a `.Renviron` file that is not committed to this repo. The input files `input.txt` are not included as it's the author of AOC's IP.

Across all solutions, I try to make use of base R and tidyverse where relevant, add comments where it's not obvious and run my functions through test cases. I will try to revisit some days to rework solutions to be more optimal when time allows. My reflections on each day is within the day folders.
