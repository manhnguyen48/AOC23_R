### **Day 10**: Pipe Maze

-   Part 1 After yesterday, this level of difficulty was expected. I spent some time implementing a graph using `igraph` in Part 1, worrying that Part 2 would use some fancy maths that would require graph computation. It's been a while since I last touched graph theory so it was quite fun.

-   Part 2 I haven't had the chance to complete as was stuck debugging why the [ray cast algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon) was not working. Probably because of some edge cases with the symbols I need to account for. But we're almost there.
