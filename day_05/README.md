### **Day 05**: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

-   Part 1 I fell for the trap of writing a mapping function for a single values but it still work. Also I probably spent too much time writing the parsing function to read the maps as data.frame.

-   Part 2 I haven't completed as it was a full day in the office + some travel, but I have the general idea that Part 1 is just a special case of Part 2, and we only need to map the end values instead of the entire range.
